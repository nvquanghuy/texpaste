    <h3>TexPaste - Pastebin for Mathematicians</h3>

    <p>Inspired by <a href='http://jsbin.com' target="_blank">JSBin</a> and
      <a target="_blank" href='http://pastebin.com/'>Pastebin</a>, I created TexPaste to help people share math formulae
      easier with their peers.</p>

    <p>For LaTeX beginners, it's also meant as a tool for them to learn the LaTeX syntax without having to go through
      the
      nuance of setting it up.</p>

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <p><strong>How long do you store my notes?</strong></p>

    <p>Your notes will never be deleted.</p>

    <p><strong>How can I edit my notes?</strong></p>

    <p>Sign up for an account then you will be able to edit your created notes</p>

    <p><strong>How is the idea born?</strong></p>

    <p>The idea is born out a discussion with my friend Nguyen Hai My. Back then he and his friends were trying to work
      on
      some Education platform, and Math rendering is a part of it. So I take that idea and marry it with Pastebin to
      make
      TexPaste.</p>

    <p>Tran Minh Luan (who worked together with Hai My) contributed the first version of JS rendering engine.</p>

    <p><strong>Is it open source?</strong></p>

    <p>Yes, you can find it here:
      <a href="https://github.com/nvquanghuy/texpaste" target="_blank">https://github.com/nvquanghuy/texpaste</a></p>

    <p>Built with Ruby on Rails, hosted on Heroku, MathJax Rendering Engine.</p>
